## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a vulnerability:

1. Ensure the bug/behaviour is reproducable, and is on the master branch (production, usually live at //yourapps.cyou/)
2. Make sure you've captured all of the steps required to reproduce it.
3. Preferrably, get a screen recording or screenshots of the bug happening (censor as much as you want, so long as it isn't needed to see the bug).
4. (Optional) Have a look through our source code - Try to locate the bug.
(For reference, all of our staticfiles are housed in [`/html`](//github.com/dragdev-studios/yourapps.cyou/tree/master/html) and the main server file is [`main.py`](//github.com/dragdev-studios/yourapps.cyou/blob/master/main.py)
5. If you followed step 4, open a pull request, and if not, please open an issue. **Prefix this with [security] so it will be seen sooner**.
6. If the security vulnerability is critical, please join our [discord server](//yourapps.cyou/support) ([alt link](//discord.gg/T9u3Qcm)) and ping developers.

Security reports will be looked into as soon as possible. We request that you don't release any security details (outside of your PR/issue) or encourage people to reproduce it.

If we have not fixed the bug after **14 days**, you are free to do whatever you would like with the information. Just don't be a bad person, basically.
